# AI/ML Implementation Details

This document provides technical details about the AI and machine learning implementation in the MovieAI recommendation app.

## Overview of Recommendation Approaches

The app implements three distinct recommendation approaches:

1. **Content-Based Filtering**
2. **Collaborative Filtering**
3. **Hybrid Approach**

## 1. Content-Based Filtering

### Algorithm Implementation

The content-based filtering algorithm recommends movies similar to those a user has previously liked, based on movie attributes such as genres, popularity, and ratings.

#### Key Components:

- **Genre Preference Calculation**: Analyzes user ratings and watch history to determine genre preferences
- **Movie Score Calculation**: Computes similarity scores between user preferences and movie attributes
- **Feature Weighting**: Applies different weights to various movie features

```typescript
// Simplified example of the content-based recommendation algorithm
private calculateMovieScore(movie: Movie, genrePreferences: Map<number, number>): number {
  const movieGenres = this.movieGenresMap.get(movie.id) || [];
  let score = 0;
  
  // Sum up genre preference weights
  for (const genreId of movieGenres) {
    score += genrePreferences.get(genreId) || 1.0;
  }
  
  // Normalize by number of genres
  if (movieGenres.length > 0) {
    score /= movieGenres.length;
  }
  
  // Factor in movie popularity and rating
  score *= (0.7 + (0.3 * (movie.vote_average / 10))); // Rating factor
  score *= (0.8 + (0.2 * (movie.popularity / 100))); // Popularity factor
  
  return score;
}
```

### Machine Learning Aspects

- **Supervised Learning**: The system learns from explicit user ratings
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts relevant features from movies and user behavior
- **Personalization**: Adapts to individual user preferences over time

## 2. Collaborative Filtering

### Algorithm Implementation

The collaborative filtering algorithm identifies users with similar tastes and recommends movies they enjoyed that the current user hasn't seen yet.

#### Key Components:

- **User Similarity Calculation**: Computes similarity between users using Pearson correlation
- **Rating Prediction**: Predicts how a user would rate movies they haven't seen
- **Neighbor Selection**: Identifies the most similar users for recommendations

```typescript
// Simplified example of user similarity calculation
private calculateUserSimilarity(user1: number, user2: number): number {
  const ratings1 = this.userRatingsMap.get(user1);
  const ratings2 = this.userRatingsMap.get(user2);
  
  if (!ratings1 || !ratings2) return 0;
  
  // Find common rated movies
  const commonMovies: number[] = [];
  
  for (const movieId of ratings1.keys()) {
    if (ratings2.has(movieId)) {
      commonMovies.push(movieId);
    }
  }
  
  if (commonMovies.length === 0) return 0;
  
  // Calculate Pearson correlation coefficient
  let sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0, sum1Sq = 0, sum2Sq = 0, pSum = 0;
  
  for (const movieId of commonMovies) {
    const rating1 = ratings1.get(movieId) || 0;
    const rating2 = ratings2.get(movieId) || 0;
    
    sum1 += rating1;
    sum2 += rating2;
    sum1Sq += rating1 * rating1;
    sum2Sq += rating2 * rating2;
    pSum += rating1 * rating2;
  }
  
  const n = commonMovies.length;
  const num = pSum - (sum1 * sum2 / n);
  const den = Math.sqrt((sum1Sq - sum1 * sum1 / n) * (sum2Sq - sum2 * sum2 / n));
  
  if (den === 0) return 0;
  
  return Math.max(0, num / den); // Return positive similarity only
}
```

### Machine Learning Aspects

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Discovers patterns in user behavior without explicit labels
- **Similarity Metrics**: Uses statistical measures to identify similar users
- **Cold Start Handling**: Addresses the challenge of new users or items

## 3. Hybrid Approach

### Algorithm Implementation

The hybrid approach combines content-based and collaborative filtering to leverage the strengths of both methods.

#### Key Components:

- **Weighted Combination**: Assigns different weights to recommendations from each method
- **Rank Fusion**: Combines ranked lists from different algorithms
- **Score Normalization**: Normalizes scores across different recommendation methods

```typescript
// Simplified example of hybrid recommendation approach
async getRecommendationsForUser(userId: number, limit: number = 10): Promise<Movie[]> {
  // Get recommendations from both systems
  const contentRecs = await this.contentRecommender.getRecommendationsForUser(userId, limit);
  const collaborativeRecs = await this.collaborativeRecommender.getRecommendationsForUser(userId, limit);
  
  // Combine and deduplicate recommendations
  const movieMap = new Map<number, {movie: Movie, score: number}>();
  
  // Add content-based recommendations with weight 0.4
  for (let i = 0; i < contentRecs.length; i++) {
    const movie = contentRecs[i];
    const score = (limit - i) / limit * 0.4; // Higher score for higher ranked movies
    movieMap.set(movie.id, {movie, score});
  }
  
  // Add collaborative recommendations with weight 0.6
  for (let i = 0; i < collaborativeRecs.length; i++) {
    const movie = collaborativeRecs[i];
    const score = (limit - i) / limit * 0.6; // Higher score for higher ranked movies
    
    if (movieMap.has(movie.id)) {
      // Movie already in map, add scores
      const existing = movieMap.get(movie.id)!;
      const newScore = existing.score + score;
      movieMap.set(movie.id, {...existing, score: newScore});
    } else {
      movieMap.set(movie.id, {movie, score});
    }
  }
  
  // Sort by score and return top movies
  return Array.from(movieMap.values())
    .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)
    .slice(0, limit)
    .map(item => item.movie);
}
```

### Machine Learning Aspects

- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines multiple algorithms for better performance
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Adjusts the influence of each algorithm based on performance
- **Cross-Validation**: Evaluates recommendation quality across different approaches

## Feedback Loop and Continuous Learning

The recommendation system implements a feedback loop to continuously improve recommendations:

1. **User Interactions**: Captures ratings, watch history, and implicit feedback
2. **Model Updates**: Periodically updates user preferences and similarity matrices
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks recommendation quality metrics

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing

- **Feature Normalization**: Scales features to comparable ranges
- **Missing Data Handling**: Addresses gaps in user ratings or movie metadata
- **Temporal Effects**: Considers recency of ratings and viewing activity

### Optimization Techniques

- **Caching**: Stores frequently accessed data and intermediate calculations
- **Batch Processing**: Updates recommendation models in batches
- **Incremental Learning**: Updates models with new data without full retraining

### Evaluation Metrics

The recommendation quality is evaluated using:

- **Precision and Recall**: Measures relevance of recommendations
- **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**: Evaluates ranking quality
- **User Satisfaction**: Implicit feedback from continued engagement

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the recommendation system:

1. **Deep Learning Integration**: Implement neural network-based recommendation models
2. **Context-Aware Recommendations**: Consider time of day, device, and other contextual factors
3. **Multi-Armed Bandit Approach**: Balance exploration of new content with exploitation of known preferences
4. **Natural Language Processing**: Analyze movie descriptions and reviews for deeper content understanding
5. **Real-Time Recommendations**: Update suggestions immediately based on user actions
